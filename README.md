# 📁 Project Structure

Each pattern has its own directory with 2 example subdirectories. Each example contains:

- `README.md` - Problem description and class diagram
- `example.py` - Source code
- `output.txt` - Execution results

# 🎯 Real-World Applications

### Strategy Pattern

- **Payment Processing**: E-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce), payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal)
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Data analysis tools (Pandas, NumPy), database optimizers, spreadsheet apps

### Decorator Pattern

- **Middleware**: Web frameworks (Django, Express), request processing, logging, authentication
- **Text Formatting**: Rich text editors (Word, Google Docs), markdown processors, HTML rendering

### Observer Pattern

- **Stock Market**: Event-driven systems, GUI frameworks, reactive programming (RxJS), MVC
- **YouTube Channel**: Social media platforms, notification systems, pub-sub architectures

### Adapter Pattern

- **Media Player**: API integrations, legacy system integration, third-party library wrappers
- **Payment Gateway**: Payment processing systems, cloud service integrations, database drivers

### Factory Pattern

- **UI Components**: GUI frameworks (Qt, Java Swing), game engines (Unity, Unreal)
- **Database Connections**: ORM frameworks (Hibernate, SQLAlchemy), connection pooling libraries

### State Pattern

- **Music Player**: Media players, workflow engines, order processing systems, UI state management
- **Traffic Light**: Embedded systems, IoT devices, automation systems, workflow management

### Composite Pattern

- **File System**: File systems, GUI component hierarchies, XML/HTML DOM trees, menu systems
- **Organization Chart**: Organizational management systems, HR software, project management tools

### Template Method Pattern

- **Recipe System**: Frameworks (Django, Spring), build systems (Maven, Gradle), data processing pipelines
- **Build Process**: Build tools (Maven, Gradle, npm), CI/CD pipelines, deployment frameworks
